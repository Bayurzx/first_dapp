Hello and welcomeüëãüèº, I am AdebayoüòÅ. I will be creating a crypto based `Will` using a simple smart contract in the Solidity programming language.
This article is largely based on the [Complete DApp - Solidity & React - Blockchain Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-dapp-solidity-react-blockchain-development/) on Udemy.

## Summary
- Little introduction to writing a smart contract
- Some common feature of solidity
- Create a smart contract and  run it in remix IDE


If you know anything about blockchain, then you might have heard about one of its applications, `smart contracts`. Smart contracts, just like regular contracts are like agreementsü§ùüèº that become valid/active when a condition is met. But with smart contracts, you can automate the execution of a contract after storing it in blockchain. No middleman, no time-delay, tamper proof and efficient making the contract, smart (*Sorry, I could not help itüòÇ*).

One of the most common IDE for writing smart contracts is the [remix](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide) IDE hosted on `ethereum.org`. This is the fastest way to get started with writing Smart contracts with solidity. It comes with all you need, a web browser-based compiler and about 15 free Ethereum account loaded with 100eth coin. These coins are on the Testnet not the Mainnet so don't even think of spending themüôÑ. 


> *Hint: You may decide to write you code in VS Code, for easier editing and copy the code to the remix IDE*
> *You will find the extension, `Solidity support for Visual Studio code` by Juan Franco very useful. It supports auto-completion syntax highlighting, Snippets and etc.*
> *There is also the `Ethereum Remix Project extension for Visual Studio Code` extension. It is in beta-release at the moment of this writing.*

### Let us dive in by creating our solidity file. I will be naming it `will.sol`. 
> *Solidity files end with the `.sol` extension.*

```solidity 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract Will {
  code...
}
```
<br>

- *Before writing your contract, it is mandatory to state the solidity version as this will determine the version of compiler that compiles the code. You should also insert the `SPDX-License-Identifier` which should be in a comment as a good practice. Checkout a full list of licenses [here](https://spdx.org/licenses/)* 

<br>

 ```solidity
 contract Will {

   ...code

    // define variables
    address owner;
    uint fortune;
    bool deceased;
    
    constructor() payable {
        // set variables
        owner = msg.sender; // represents address called
        fortune = msg.value; // how much ether is being represents
        deceased = false;
    }

  code...
  
 }
 ```
 <br>

- We define our three state variables (`owner`, `fortune` and `deceased`) which would be stored in this contract storage. It is necessary to always state your variable `type` when defining variables in solidity. There are wayyy to many `types` used in solidity. This `types` affects how a contract interacts with data variables, functions etc.

- State, Local, Global variable are the three types of variables in solidity
  - `Local variables` just like in JavaScript are scoped variables, they are often defined in functions and serve out their purpose in the function.
  - `State variables` are defined outside of functions, they are sort of the global variables in JS
  - `Global Variables` are special pre-defined variables that can exist globally across contracts. `msg.sender` is an example of global variables
- Constructors are often used to initialize state variables of a contract and are executed only once when the contract was created. Read more [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_constructors.htm)

### Next, we created two modifiers, an array and then mapped addresses to amount of inheritance
``` solidity
  ...code

    // define modifier functions that only owner can call it
    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _; // function body is inserted where the special symbol "_;" add to functions
    }
    
    // create modifier functions to only allocate funds if deceased
    modifier mustBeDeceased {
        require(deceased == true);
        _; // function body is inserted where the special symbol "_;" add to functions
    }

    // list of family wallets
    address payable [] familyWallets;

    // map through inheritance
    // this enables us to set the inheritance later on
    mapping(address => uint) inheritance;

    code...
```

- `Modifier` Functions are sort of conditions that will allow another function to run if true. It works well with `require()` or `if statement`. 
  - With `require` you can add a string as a second argument to be outputted when the condition is not met

- You create lists in Solidity by indicating the square bracket ahead of its name like this:  `[] familyWallets;`. In this example, we indicated the types:  `address` and `payable`. 
  - This ensures that the content are Ethereum addresses and allows for payment respectively

- Mapping helps us to pair `_key` and `_value` data. This is like `objects data type` in JavaScript.

``` solidity
    // set inheritance for each address basically by attributing the amount to address

    function setInheritance(address payable wallet, uint amount) public onlyOwner {
        // add wallet to the family wallets
        familyWallets.push(wallet);
        inheritance[wallet] = amount;
    }

    // pay each family based on their wallet address

    function payout() private mustBeDeceased {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < familyWallets.length; i++) {
            // familyWallets[i].transfer(inheritance[familyWallets[i]]);
            // or
            (bool success, ) = familyWallets[i].call{value:inheritance[familyWallets[i]]}("");
            require(success, "Transfer failed.");

        }
    }

```

- The setInhertiance function receives two arguments `wallet` and `amount`
  - As you may have noticed, wallet has two types `payable` and `address` while `amount` has `uint`(unsigned integer) type aka `uint32`
- We then push each `wallet` into the list(familyWallet) created earlier and designate an `amount` to be inherited
- The `payout` simply loops each `wallet` in family wallet and transfers the corresponding amount`(mapping)`: `<wallet.transfer(amount)>`
- Notice the two lines of code commented above `//or`, it‚Äôs an alternative to `transfer` method. The `transfer` method is avoided sometimes because of the hard dependency on gas costs. Read up on this here and [here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/78124/is-transfer-still-safe-after-the-istanbul-update/78136#78136) 
  - `(bool success, )` checks to see if transfer was successful else returns "Transfer failed"
- Note that the visibility is set to private. private is one of the four common visibility type [Public, private, internal, external]. It ensures that the function is not called outside the contract

```solidity
      // oracle switch simulation
    function payWill() public onlyOwner {
        deceased = true;
        payout();
    }
```

`paywill` function enables us to call the `payout` function whose visibility was set to `private` after I ensured that the `onlyOwner` and `mustBeDeceased` conditions are met.

## Here is where things start to get interesting, Let's run the contract in our [remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

![compile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bayurzx/first_dapp/main/screenshots/remix_compile.jpg)

- When you are done writing the contract, you should go ahead to click the compile button. If you get the green tick ‚úî, you are good to go 


> *You might have noticed that the compile version and pragma solidity `<version>` are the same. Hence why it is mandatory to indicate it at the beginning of your file*  

![compile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bayurzx/first_dapp/main/screenshots/remix_deploy.jpg)

- `A.` => Take note of the account you will be using, it's where your gas fee and the `msg.value` global variable for every contract execution comes from.
- `B` => To make use of Ethereum in the contract, you need to deposit it through the `value` input. 1 eth = 10<sup>18</sup> wei. Make sure to select `eth`
- `D` => After clicking deploy, you will notice a ‚úî right above the terminal 

![compile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bayurzx/first_dapp/main/screenshots/remix_deploy2.jpg)
- After successful deployment, inspect the IDE, at `B` you should click the `caret-down icon` it reveals the two defined public functions in our contract
  - At `C`, there is the setInheritance function with the expected arguments `wallet` and `amount`. 
  - Go back to the list of account and select any other account to copy the eth address, click the copy icon beside it. **Remember to return to the first account when done**
  - When selecting an amount. Put in mind that the default is in `wei` you will need to add 18 zeros to make it equal to an Ethereum `1eth` => `1000000000000000000wei`
  - Do this repeatedly to add more address to the `familyWallet` list. *Reminder, make sure to go back to the first account after copying other eth address*
  - Click transact to run the function. You will see another ‚úî. 

>*Note: The limit of Ethereum you can process is the amount added which is 30eth*
  
- After repeating the setInheritance process, you can finally select the payWill button to complete the contract.
